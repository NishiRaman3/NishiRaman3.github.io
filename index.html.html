                <h1>Apple</h1>

                <div>
                    <p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
                        Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
                        The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found.
                        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North
                        America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
                        cultures,
                        including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>


                    <p> Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant
                        fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by
                        clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much
                        slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size
                        of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.</p>

                    <p> There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes
                        and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to
                        fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and
                        non-organic means.
                        In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective
                        breeding in
                        apple production.</p>

                    Worldwide production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half
                    of the total.[3]

                    <h3>Etymology</h3>
                    <p>
                        The word apple, whose Old English ancestor is æppel, is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun
                        *aplaz, descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ébōl.[citation needed]
                        As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit including
                        nuts—such as the 14th-century Middle English expression appel of paradis, meaning a banana.[4]

                    <h3>Description</h3>

                    <h4>Apple morphology</h4>

                    <p> Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (Malus domestica)
                        The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation
                        and up
                        to 9 m (30
                        ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock
                        selection and
                        trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with
                        serrated
                        margins and
                        slightly downy undersides.[5]</p>


                    <h4>Apple blossom</h4>

                    <p> Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are
                        produced on spurs and some
                        long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+0.5 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that
                        gradually fades, five
                        petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4-6 flowers. The central flower of
                        the inflorescence is
                        called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6]</p>

                    <p>The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide
                        range of sizes.
                        Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+0.75 to 3+0.25 in) in
                        diameter, due to market
                        preference. Some consumers, especially in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples less
                        than 5.5 cm (2+0.25 in)
                        are generally used for juicing and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples
                        is red, yellow,
                        green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.[7] The
                        skin may also be wholly
                        or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of
                        epicuticular wax.[8] The
                        exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green exocarps
                        also occur.[9]</p>
